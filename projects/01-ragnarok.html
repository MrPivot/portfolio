	<h3> - Description - </h3>
	
	<p>
	Sym.BIOS is a turn-based tactical RPG where you lead a team of mechs, customized by you, with the goal of destroying your opponent and capturing their base. 
	This project was built with a team of +/- 20 people during one entire school year.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As the procedural programmer I was responsible for the implementation of procedural level generation for which I did all implementation in C++.
	I spent the second and third quarter of the year implementating the procedural level generation system which used Unreal's level streaming to build up the general level layout out of chunks and then procedurally spawned the cover in the level.
	Last quarter of the year I overhauled parts of this system for a completely new level which was more focused on balanced gameplay for player versus player multiplayer games.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In the last quarter of the year I also picked up the role of feature team lead for the networking.
	As networking feature team lead I was responsible for the planning, breakdown and assignment of networking tasks, organization of feature team meetings, and I was the main communication point with the producer and tech lead related to networking.
	Next to this I also implemented parts of the networking myself, initially using Unreal's networking but this later switched to a database oriented approach.
